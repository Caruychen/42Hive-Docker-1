# For this to work, the following ports need to be open:
# * TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
# * TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
# * UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic
# Unfortunately, looks like these aren't open on the iMacs, and you'd need sudo rights to open them.
# I made 2 VMs, with one as the manager and the other as the worker. They are given the respective static IP addresses:
# 10.12.203.42
# 10.12.203.84
# After setting up VM on virtualbox, set up ssh port connection to the VM.
# I'm using debian VM, use the instructions in this link to install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
